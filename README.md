Today marks the bittersweet conclusion of my journey at the Data Analytics Bootcamp. This program equipped me with essential skills in SQL, Excel, and Tableau, which I utilized to present my final project, "US Flight Delay Analysis."

As my first-ever project, it presented a significant challenge, especially as I transitioned from a non-tech background. Learning and catching up within just three weeks was intense! Nevertheless, the value of the experience and knowledge gained was immeasurable.

Overall Conclusion:

Based on our analysis, several key observations have been made:
•	Coastal states, particularly Texas, California, and Florida, have consistently recorded the highest total number of flight delays in the United States from 2017 to 2022. 
•	While Southwest Airlines had the most delayed flights, the difference was not statistically significant compared to American Airlines and SkyWest Airlines. 
•	The total hours of flight delays caused by carriers has experienced a slight increase from 38.5% to 43.2% over five years. 

This analysis highlights the need for enhanced preparedness in coastal regions, operational improvements by airlines, and ongoing monitoring of carrier-related delays.

Recommendations:
1.	Coastal States (Texas, California, Florida):
•	Enhance weather-related preparedness, infrastructure, and air traffic management systems to mitigate delays caused by external factors.

2.	Airlines (Including Southwest, American, SkyWest):
•	Implement operational improvements, optimize schedules, and enhance passenger communication to minimize delays.
•	Collaborate with other airlines to identify best practices in reducing delays.
